Every round someone will be assigned to be the active player. They will be given the "Keller" role making them unable to hear voice chat and read the text chat.

A random noun will be given to the rest of the players who will then DM their clues (wrapped in quotation marks) to the bot.

The bot will then present the clues to the players who must vote on which clues to cancel.

The active player will regain the ability to listen and read, and will be presented the remaining clues by the bot. They will then have to respond with their guess.

The group will then all vote to determine the correctness of the guess.
